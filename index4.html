                        <h2>Competition rules </h2>
                        <p>
                            Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) competitions follow specific rules that dictate how matches are conducted, scored, and how winners are determined. The rules vary slightly between different organizations (like the International Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Federation (IBJJF), ADCC, and others), but the most commonly followed set of rules comes from the IBJJF. Here’s a breakdown of the key competition rules:
                        </p>
                    </article>
                    <section>
                        <h3>Match Structure:</h3>
                        <h4>Duration:</h4>
                        <p>Matches usually last between 5 to 10 minutes, depending on the competitor's belt rank and the competition. Common time limits include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>White belt: 5 minutes</li>
                            <li>Blue belt: 6 minutes</li>
                            <li>Purple belt: 7 minutes</li>
                            <li>Brown belt: 8 minutes
                            </li>
                            <li>Black belt: 10 minutes</li>
                        </ul>
                    </section>
                    <section id="Weight Classes">
                        <h4>Weight Classes:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Competitors are divided into weight categories to ensure fairness. These categories vary by gender and age and differ slightly between gi and no-gi events.</li>
                            <li>Competitors must weigh in before the competition and be within their category's weight limit.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </section>
                    <section id="Match Outcome">
                        <h4>Match Outcome:</h4>
                        <p>A match can be won in the following ways:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Submission: A competitor forces the opponent to submit by tapping out or verbally conceding due to a submission hold (e.g., choke, joint lock).</li>
                            <li>Points: If no submission occurs, the match is decided by points, awarded for dominant positions and maneuvers.</li>
                            <li>Referee decision: If points are tied and no submission occurs, the referee will decide the winner based on aggression, control, and attempts to finish the match.</li>
                            <li>Disqualification: A competitor can be disqualified for illegal moves, poor sportsmanship, or rule violations.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </section>
                    <section id="Points system">
                        <h3>Points system</h3>
                        <p>
                            Points are awarded based on the successful execution of certain moves and positions that demonstrate control and advancement toward a submission. Here’s how points are typically scored in an IBJJF competition:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Takedown (2 points): Bringing the opponent to the ground and establishing control.</li>
                            <li>Sweep (2 points): Reversing the opponent from the bottom guard position to a top position.</li>
                            <li>Knee on Belly (2 points): Controlling the opponent from the top by placing the knee on their stomach, demonstrating dominance.</li>
                            <li>Guard Pass (3 points): Moving from the opponent’s guard to a dominant position (side control).</li>
                            <li>Mount (4 points): Sitting on top of the opponent’s chest with both knees on the ground.</li>
                            <li>Back Control (4 points): Controlling the opponent from behind, with hooks (legs) in or body triangle secured.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </section>
                    <section id="Advantages">
                        <h3>Advantages:</h3>
                        <p>
                            In addition to points, competitors can earn advantages for near-successful submission attempts or positional control that doesn’t last long enough to score full points. Advantages are used to break ties if the match ends with an equal score.
                        </p>
                        <li>Example: If a competitor attempts a submission or sweep but doesn't fully complete it, they may earn an advantage instead of full points.</li>
                    </section>
                    <section id="Illegal Moves">
                        <h3>Illegal Moves:</h3>
                        <p>
                            Certain moves are banned depending on the competitor's belt level and division (gi/no-gi). These rules are in place to protect competitors from injury. Common illegal moves include:
                        </p>
                        <h4>White belts</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>No wrist locks, heel hooks, or toe holds.</li>
                            <li>No neck cranks.</li>
                            <li>No scissor takedowns.</li>
                            <li>No jumping guard.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Higher Belts (Blue to Black Belt)</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Heel hooks and knee reaping (crossing your leg across the opponent's hip in certain ways) are often banned in gi but allowed in no-gi, depending on the competition rules (e.g., ADCC allows heel hooks).</li>
                            <li>No slamming: A competitor cannot slam their opponent to escape submissions or guards.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Children and Juveniles:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>There are stricter rules in place for younger competitors to protect them from injuries, such as bans on leg locks and certain joint submissions.</li>
                        </ul>

                            <li>Knee Reaping: Intentionally placing your leg across the opponent's hip in a way that torques their knee (in gi competitions).</li>
                            <li>Slams: Lifting and forcefully slamming an opponent to the mat.</li>
                            <li>Unnecessary roughness: Excessive force or unsportsmanlike conduct can lead to penalties or disqualification.</li>

                        <p>In some competitions, especially no-gi or submission-only tournaments (e.g., ADCC or EBI), if no winner is decided within the regular match time, the match enters overtime with modified rules:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Sudden death rounds where the first competitor to score or submit wins.
                            </li>
                            <li>Special overtime positions (e.g., back control or armbar position) where the competitor who escapes or submits faster wins</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Weight Cutting:</h3>
                        <p>In many BJJ competitions, competitors may cut weight to compete in a lower weight division. Weight must be made at the time of the weigh-in, which may be directly before or the day before the match.</p>

                                BJJ competition rules ensure fairness and safety while encouraging technical skills, strategic thinking, and submission hunting. Competitors must understand these rules to succeed in matches and avoid penalties or disqualification. The exact rules depend on the organization and event type, but most follow similar structures.
