                      Brazilian jiu-jitsu (Portuguese: jiu-jitsu brasileiro), often abbreviated to BJJ, is a self-defense martial art and combat sport based on grappling, ground fighting, and submission holds. It is primarily a ground-based fighting style and focuses on taking one's opponent down to the ground, gaining a dominant position, and using a number of techniques to force them into submission via joint locks, chokeholds, or compression locks.

                      BJJ revolves around the concept that a smaller, weaker person can successfully defend themselves against a bigger, stronger opponent by using leverage and weight distribution, taking the fight to the ground and using a number of holds and submissions to defeat them. Sparring, commonly referred to as "rolling" within the BJJ community, and live drilling plays a major role in the practitioner's development. In contrast to some other martial arts BJJ can be practiced both using a gi uniform or not which is known as 'no-gi BJJ', for this purpose rash guards are used. The International Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Federation (IBJJF) is the main governing body of the martial art, establishing the rules and general guidelines, as well as promoting competitions and training of referees. BJJ can also be used as a method of promoting physical fitness, building character, and as a way of life.

                      Brazilian jiu-jitsu focuses on getting an opponent to the ground in order to neutralize possible strength or size advantages through ground fighting techniques and submission holds involving joint-locks and chokeholds. On the ground, physical strength can be offset or enhanced through proper grappling techniques.

                      BJJ employs a wide range of takedown techniques to bring an opponent to the ground such as "pulling guard", which is not used in other combat sports such as judo or wrestling. Once the opponent is on the ground, a number of manoeuvres (and counter-manoeuvres) are available to manipulate the opponent into a suitable position for the application of a submission technique. Achieving a dominant position on the ground is one of the hallmarks of BJJ, which includes effective use of the guard position to defend oneself from bottom (using both submissions and sweeps, with sweeps leading to the possibility of dominant position or an opportunity to pass the guard), and passing the guard to dominate from top position with side control, mount, and back mount positions. This system of manoeuvring and manipulation can be likened to a form of kinetic or physical chess when executed by two experienced practitioners. A submission hold in BJJ is often likened to the equivalent of "checkmate", where the opponent is left with no other option but to tap, be injured, or choked.
