            <h2>Ground fighting</h2>
            <p>
                Brazilian jiu-jitsu is mainly differentiated from other martial arts by its greater emphasis on ground fighting. BJJ places less emphasis on standing techniques, such as striking and throws, although takedowns score points and the rules allows for a diverse range of techniques such as single, double leg takedowns, or foot sweeps. Some BJJ practitioners also cross train with wrestling, judo, and sambo

            <article id="Side control">
                <h3>Side control</h3>
                <p>
                    An Americana armlock submission from traditional side control.
                    In side control, the practitioner pins his opponent to the ground from the side of their torso. The top grappler lies across the opponent with weight applied to the opponent's chest. The opponent may be further controlled by pressure on either side of the shoulders and hips from the practitioner's elbows, shoulders, and knees. A wide variety of submissions can be initiated from side control. It is also referred to as the side mount and "cem quilos" (a hundred kilograms) in Brazilian Portuguese. Additionally, the typical side mount increases opportunity for the top grappler to advance to other dominant positions. This position is often used in MMA as it allows the top fighter to strike whilst overcoming their opponents defense. There are many variants of the side control position, including kesa gatame, standard side control, reverse side control, and other positions.

                <h3>Knee on belly position</h3>
                <p>
                    The knee on belly position is a modified side pin that is distinctly separated from the side control position. The knee on belly position is characterized primarily by the control of the opponent with one leg out for base and balance and the other leg positioned across the opponent's torso pinning them to the ground. This form of pin is a mobile pin rather than a static pin and is considered a more dominant position in many grappling formats. The knee on belly position is worth additional points because it provides a greater striking platform than traditional side control and is closer to achieving the more ideal mounted position.

            <article id="Mount">
                <h3>Full mount</h3>
                <p>
                    In the mount (or full mount) position, the practitioner sits astride the opponent's front torso or chest, controlling the opponent with his bodyweight and hips. In the strongest form of this position, the practitioner works his knees into the opponent's armpits to reduce arm movements and ability to move or counter submission attempts. Full Mount can be used to apply a variety of submissions including armlocks or chokes.
                </p>
                <h4>Back mount</h4>
                <p>
                    When taking the back mount position (often known in Brazilian jiu-jitsu as the back grab or attacking the back), the practitioner attaches to the back of the opponent by wrapping his legs around and hooking the opponent's thighs with their heel,or locking in a body triangle by crossing one shin across the waist like a belt then placing the back of the opposing knee over the instep as if finishing a triangle choke. Simultaneously, the upper body is controlled by wrapping the arms around the chest or neck of the opponent. This position is often used to apply chokeholds, as well as arm bars and triangles, and neutralizes an opponent's potential size or strength advantage

            <article id="North south position">
                <h3>North south position</h3>
                <p>
                    The North South position occurs when a practitioner is lying on their back on the ground and their opponent is lying on top, with the head over the chest area and controlling the bottom practitioner's arms. As with most top controlling positions in BJJ, the top practitioner applies pressure by bringing their hips downwards towards the ground, generating what is referred to as dead weight. There are several submissions and transitions that are possible from the North South position, most commonly the North South choke, North South kimura, and others.

            <article id="Guards">
                <h3>Guards</h3>
                <p>
                    When in the "Guard" position, the practitioner is on their back controlling an opponent with his legs. The bottom practitioner pushes and pulls with the legs or feet to unbalance and limit the movements of his opponent. This position allows practitioners a wide variety of counter-attacks from the bottom position, including submissions and sweeps.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The three most common types of guards include the Closed Guard, Half Guard, and Open Guard.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In closed guard, the bottom grappler has his legs around the opponent's hips, with ankles closed together to control their opponent. The closed guard can be an effective position. This guard allows many setups for submissions such as joint locks and chokes, as well as sweeps. In the open guard, the legs are not hooked together and the bottom grappler uses his legs or feet to push or pull their opponent.
                </p> 
              
                <p>
                    There are many variations of open guard with distinct names and positioning.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Closed guard</li>
                    <dd>
                        In closed guard, the bottom grappler has his legs around the opponent's hips, with ankles closed together to control their opponent. The closed guard can be an effective position. This guard allows many setups for submissions such as joint locks and chokes, as well as sweeps. In the open guard, the legs are not hooked together and the bottom grappler uses his legs or feet to push or pull their opponent.
                    </dd>

                    <li>Butterfly Guard</li>
                    <dd>
                        Butterfly guard is when the bottom grappler brings his legs up and feet together against the inner thighs of top opponent. The name is derived from the resulting butterfly wing shape. Butterfly guard increases both space to maneuver and the ability to counter the opponent with the shins or arches of the feet against the competitor's inner thighs.
                    </dd>

                    <li>De La Riva Guard</li>
                    <dd>
                        The De La Riva Guard (DLR) is an open guard technique in Brazilian jiu-jitsu, named after the renowned competitor Ricardo De La Riva. While not an entirely new concept in grappling, as it had origins in nonatei style judo credited to Oda Tsunetane, it gained prominence through De La Riva's use. In Brazilian jiu-jitsu, the DLR Guard is identified when a competitor lies on their back, controlling their opponent with open legs. This position is defined by one leg hooking outside the opponent's leg (e.g., the guard player's left leg hooking the passer's right leg), thereby compromising the passer's balance. This outside hook is what distinguishes the DLR Guard from other open guards. The De La Riva Guard is pivotal in modern jiu-jitsu, serving as a foundation for many advanced guard techniques developed since its introduction.

                    <li>X-Guard</li>
                    <dd>
                        It involves the bottom player positioning their body underneath the standing opponent, hooking one leg deeply with both legs while controlling the other leg with the arms. This guard provides leverage and balance disruption, making it effective for destabilizing the opponent and setting up sweeps or submissions. It's commonly used to transition to dominant positions, especially in gi and no-gi grappling.
                    </dd>

                    <li>K-Guard</li>
                    <dd>
                        It involves the bottom player positioning one leg in front of the opponent's body, usually across their midsection, while the other leg comes underneath or around the opponent's far leg. The bottom player uses this positioning to gain control of the opponent’s legs and hips, setting up sweeps, back takes, or leg attacks such as heel hooks and other submissions. The K-Guard is particularly effective in no-gi grappling and has become popular in leg lock-heavy strategies.
                    </dd>

                    <li>Rubber guard</li>
                    <dd> 
                        It focuses on maintaining tight control over the opponent from the bottom, primarily in closed guard, using a combination of arm and leg positioning. In the Rubber Guard, the bottom player pulls one leg high up to their opponent's shoulder, often hooking it behind the opponent's head, while controlling their posture with the same-side arm.
                    </dd>
                    <dd>
                        The goal of the Rubber Guard is to break the opponent's posture and limit their ability to strike or pass guard, especially in MMA. It sets up submissions such as the triangle, omoplata, or the gogoplata, while maintaining a strong defensive position. Flexibility and hip mobility are key to effectively using this guard.
                    </dd>

                    <li>Spider Guard</li>
                    <dd>
                        Spider guard is when the bottom grappler puts one or two of his feet on his opponents arms, this guard is effective at keeping control on the bottom and can be used to set up sweeps or submissions.
                    </dd>

                    <li>Octopus Guard</li>
                    <dd>
                        It involves the bottom player reaching around the back of the opponent while being in a half-guard or seated guard position, wrapping an arm around their torso or back, while also often trapping one of the opponent's legs.

                        From this position, the bottom player can control the opponent’s posture and movement while setting up sweeps, back takes, or submissions.
                    </dd>
                    <li>Lapel Guard</li>
                    <dd>
                        that involves using the opponent's lapel (the fabric of their gi) to create grips and control for sweeps, submissions, or positional advantages. This guard is predominantly used in gi BJJ, where the lapel can be manipulated to create leverage and immobilize the opponent.
                    </dd>
                    <dd>
                        The Lapel Guard allows the bottom player to tie up the opponent's limbs, limiting their movement while maintaining strong control. It’s a highly strategic guard that slows down the opponent and opens up a wide range of attacks and transitions. It was heavily developed and popularized by BJJ world champion Keenan Cornelius.
                    </dd>

                    <li>Worm Guard (made popular by Keenan Cornelius)</li>
                    <dd>
                        It involves using the opponent's gi lapel to control their posture and movement, particularly to neutralize their ability to pass the guard while setting up sweeps or transitions to dominant positions.
                    </dd>
                    <dd>
                        To execute the Worm Guard, the player on the bottom feeds the opponent’s lapel under their own leg (typically the leg closest to the opponent’s), wrapping it around the opponent’s leg. The lapel grip, combined with De La Riva-style hooks, provides leverage and control. This ties up the opponent's legs, making it difficult for them to move or base, and opens up opportunities for sweeps and back takes.
                    </dd>

                    <li>Half Guard</li>
                    <dd>
                        In the half guard, one of the top grappler's legs is controlled by the bottom grappler's legs, preventing the top opponent from passing side control or full mount positions. There is also a variant of half guard called "50/50 guard", which consist of each opponent usually in sitting positions with one of their legs hooking the same leg of their opponent in a mirrored fashion. This position is called 50/50 because neither opponent has a distinct advantage, where both sides have the same possibilities of sweeps and attacks.
                    </dd>
                    <dd>
                        Another variation of the half guard position is the "deep half guard", which involves the bottom grappler positioning themselves underneath their opponent, grabbing the top grappler's thigh. This gives the individual on the bottom the opportunity to sweep their opponent, and end up on a more dominant, top position. This position was popularized by American BJJ Black Belt, Jeff Glover.
