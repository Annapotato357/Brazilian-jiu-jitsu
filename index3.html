                  <h3>Gi</h3>
                    <p>In Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ), the uniform is called a gi (also known as a kimono), and it plays an important role in both the practice and culture of the sport. There are two main types of uniforms in BJJ: gi and no-gi attire, depending on the style being practiced.</p>
                    <p>Gi (Kimono) – The gi consists of a jacket, pants, and a belt. It is made of thick, durable cotton designed to withstand the gripping, pulling, and friction common in BJJ.</p>
                </article>

                <article>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Jacket:</li>
                        <dd>
                            The jacket is made from a tough, often woven fabric to resist wear and tear during training. It has a reinforced collar for defensive grips and techniques.
                        </dd>
                        <dd>
                            Gi colors typically include white, blue, and black, although other colors are sometimes allowed in training or certain competitions. Some gyms or academies may have specific uniform requirements, but the most commonly accepted colors are white, blue, and black for competitions.
                        </dd>                    
                        <li>Pants:</li> 
                        <dd>
                            The pants are also made from sturdy material and often have reinforced knees for durability.
                        </dd>
                        <li>Belt:</li>
                        <dd>
                            The belt signifies the practitioner's rank and is tied around the waist. It comes in various colors, with the primary progression.
                        </dd>

                  <h3>No-Gi BJJ Uniform:</h3>
                  <p>
                    In no-gi BJJ, practitioners do not wear the traditional gi. Instead, they wear:
                  </p>
                    <ul>

                      <li>Rash Guard:</li> 
                      <dd>
                        A tight-fitting, long or short-sleeved top made of moisture-wicking material. Rash guards prevent skin irritation from the mat and reduce the risk of rashes or burns caused by friction.
                      </dd>
                      <li>Spats/Shorts</li>
                      <dd>
                        No-gi grapplers often wear spats (compression pants) or grappling shorts. The shorts are durable and often designed to allow a full range of motion. Spats provide skin protection from friction and are sometimes worn under shorts.
                      </dd>
                    </ul>
                  <p>

                    Beltless System – In no-gi, there is no belt system, but the rank is still recognized. Grapplers often wear rash guards that indicate their rank (e.g., blue, purple, brown, or black), particularly in competition.

                  <h3>Differences Between Gi and No-Gi:</h3>
                  <p>
                    Gi BJJ: In gi, the uniform allows for grips on the opponent’s collar, sleeves, and pants, making it a more technical and slower game with many grips and control options.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    No-Gi BJJ: Without the gi, there are no grips on clothing, so practitioners rely on body grips and underhooks, leading to faster-paced matches with a focus on athleticism, scrambling, and submissions like leg locks.
                  </p>
                  <h3>Practical Aspects:</h3>
                  <p>
                    Comfort and Fit: The gi should fit properly, not too loose or tight, and must adhere to competition rules regarding sleeve length, gi thickness, and overall size.
                    Hygiene: Proper gi care is essential. Practitioners should regularly wash their gis to maintain hygiene and prevent the spread of skin infections like ringworm or staph. A clean gi also shows respect for training partners.

                    <h2>Belts</h2>
                    <p>
                      The belt system in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) is a progression system that reflects a practitioner's skill, knowledge, and experience. The belts serve as a visible indicator of rank and development, with progression typically taking many years of dedicated training. Here's a breakdown of the belt system for adults and children:

                  <p>Each belt level (except black belt) can have up to four stripes, which represent progress within that belt. Stripes are awarded based on training time, skill development, and often at the instructor’s discretion. They serve as milestones between belt promotions and help motivate practitioners by recognizing improvement.</p>

                        After earning a black belt, practitioners continue to progress through degrees (or "dans") of black belts over time. Degrees are marked by white stripes on the black belt.
                      </p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>1st to 6th degree: These are typically awarded every 3 years for continued practice and contribution to BJJ.</li>
                        <li>7th degree: At this stage, practitioners are awarded a red and black belt (coral belt) after about 30+ years of being a black belt.</li>
                        <li>8th degree: Practitioners receive the red and white belt (coral belt) after many more years of dedication.</li>
                        <li>9th and 10th degree: These are represented by the red belt, reserved for the most senior and influential members of the BJJ community. The 10th degree is generally recognized only for the founding members of BJJ (the Gracie family).</li>
